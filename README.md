# PAC2022Marandi__DengueML_Plasma_Leakage

Official code repository for the paper "[Development of a machine learning model for early prediction of plasma leakage in suspected dengue patients](https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010758)" by Marandi et al., 2022.

## Software requirements
Tested on RStudio (R v4.1.2)

## Usage
1. Download the files in the repository (copy all in one directory).  
2. Run the run_service.R in RStudio (make sure you have installed the required R packages: mlr3 and plumber). 
3. It opens a new window in which the API is available to use (the API is also accessible on your web browser). 
4. Please follow the descriptions in the API for usage.
5. The model (DENV5F_AS_model.rda) can also individually be used inside R environment for prediction tasks.
